_/ Finger Family Fun! Elsa Anna Spiderman Batman Joker Superheroes In Real Life /_

James Bridle's essay, "Something is wrong on the internet", is an alarming reveal of algorithms
that exist on Youtube that I'd never once noticed. After reading the article, and watching Bridle's
TED Talk on the same subject, I took to searching for these videos. At best, they were mind-numbing,
and at worst, they were disturbing in ways that were occasionally difficult to pinpoint, and other
times blatantly wrong. I wanted to focus in on one trend I found particularly disturbing, the
'Finger Family' type of videos.

This project essentially randomly generates a finger family. When the user says the name of a finger,
(example: 'index', 'middle', etc.) the finger randomly generates a new finger family member. There
are more chances of getting a seemingly wholesome finger family member than not. However, the more times
the user engages, the more chances there are of a more disturbing finger family member appearing,
seemingly out of nowhere. This highlights what happened when I let Youtube's autoplay feature
take over during my research into this content. I came across countless live action videos of Elsa
and Spiderman in increasingly odd and specific situations- along with Mickey and Minnie Mouse, in
cartoon forms, allowing their children to be kidnapped or in borderline perverse situations.
I was shocked and could only imagine what this could do to small children, especially those
these videos are technically targeted at- toddlers who rely on autoplay algorithms to guide
them to their next video of choice.

This project is mainly created with Javascript, along with arrays and Annyang's voice recognition software.
The voice recognition is unfortunately a bit difficult to work with, and on occasion, doesn't pick up a certain
word (thumb being the most difficult to date). However, I do hope to have captured the unsettling feeling
of watching those very videos on Youtube, along with the algorithmic descent into much more terrifying territory
for children.

If I ever expanded this project, I would add a much larger database of fingers to randomly
generate. Properly cutting and pasting the graphics was the lengthiest part of this project,
and I had less time than anticipated, so I unfortunately couldn't add as many random components
as I hoped to initially. I also intended to try and clean up the code, to generalize the separate
functions into one cohesive one, but couldn't find out where I had gone wrong, so I kept each finger function
separate for the final product to work.

Thankfully, I do think a lot of good came out of this project, too. On a technical level, arrays make
a lot more sense to me- I initially struggled a lot with them, as well as the Javascript math and random
functions.
