Claustro-tab-ia
by Macey McCormick

When I first considered Sisphyus, I was at a mild loss for ideas. However,
inspiration came from one of the best forms: experience. Many fellow classmates
gawk at the sheer amount of tabs I always have open on my browser at any time.
Sometimes, it feels a Sisphyian task even for me to close them all, as they
retain web pages I want to save for later and will forget about if I bookmark.

Therefore, I recreated an experience using jQuery UI with tabs. I wanted
it to be impossible to close every tab, and I achieved this by perhaps painstakingly
considering dynamic code for adding new tabs. The new versions of jQuery have
removed the easier "add" and "remove" functions for tabs, which made this project
much harder than initially anticipated. With a number of sacrifices in my original
ambition, I've implemented the basic functionality of what I was aiming for.

Tabs are generated at a steady rate. Just as you think you will succeed and close
all of them, new ones are generated faster as you approach your goal. This makes
the experience endless and pointless, much like Sisphyus pushing a boulder up a
hill for eternity. So long as the user engages with the experience, they are
creating a similar torture for themselves.

I initially hoped to use arrays in a creative way to randomize tab titles and
content, but had much difficulty working with strings. I compromised by
adding a limited amount of flavor text that only continues to question you as to
why you continue to engage, asking questions such as "Why even bother?", and
"What's the point?"

I do hope to eventually implement the arrays, as well as more aesthetic tweaks,
UI buttons, proper (and multiple) sounds, and perhaps more chaos (perhaps generating
windows with new tabs on them as well!) I would like to drive the effect home
by cluttering the screen and making the user itch to respond and engage, even
though there is no winning, and the experience is therefore futile.
