*/ Project 3 Prototype /*
   by Macey McCormick

When the cursor is pointed at the sphere, generative sound will play.
When the cursor moves off of the sphere, the sound will stop.
This prototype is hopefully the beginning of a playful, 3D VR way of looking
at and playing with sound and soundscapes.
